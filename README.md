### Other Requirements

In order to execute our algorithms, an accout with Alpaca Algorithmic Traders is needed. Please create a file named ```params.json``` within the project base directory. This file must appear as follows:

```
{
    "alpaca_public":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "alpaca_private":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "alpaca_url":"https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"
}
```
Inclusion of this file will allow each script to connect and interact with your Alpaca account, in order to recieve market data and total account equity, but also complete market_orders and manage portfolio standings.
