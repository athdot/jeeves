# Jeeves v2.1.2 - "Zelenskyy"
Python Auto-Trader with Alpaca API

Compatable trading algorithms and scripts are stored in our lib/ folder

### Recent Version Notes
- Changes of ```lpLongShortBeta.py``` to allow account to bypass PDT restrictions by flip-flopping between which stock universe is being currently processed. Stocks are held for 24 hrs (72 hours on the weekend). With the current setup, considering no stock goes outside the stop-loss points, PDT lockdown should be avoided.
- Addition of a reporting system with MailJet API, additionally with the inclusion of charts etc

### Algorithm Creation

To create a new algorithm, you must do 3 things
- Create a new .py file of the name you choose, with a class named "TradeAlgo"
- Add a .run() function to be invocated
- Place function into the lib/ folder

#### Variables of Note
- os.environ["APCA_API_BASE_URL"]
- os.environ["APCA_API_KEY_ID"]
- os.environ["APCA_API_SECRET_KEY"]
- os.environ["STOCK_UNIVERSE"]

### Other Requirements

In order to execute our algorithms, an accout with Alpaca Algorithmic Traders is needed. Please create a file named ```params.json``` within the project base directory. This file must appear as follows:

```
{
    "alpaca_public":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "alpaca_private":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "alpaca_url":"https://paper-api.alpaca.markets",
    "mailjet_public":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "mailjet_private":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "mailjet_sender":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "mailjet_reciever":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
Inclusion of this file will allow each script to connect and interact with your Alpaca account, in order to recieve market data and total account equity, but also complete market_orders and manage portfolio standings.
